1. Background colors: 

 - Spotify green #1DB954 **BUT** instead of using green - go with some interesting variation of purple
 - White #FFFFFF
 - Black #191414

2. Fonts(Spotify Circular): how-to and more - study [this](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/design-and-branding/) before adding. Apply only what will be used, do not overkill it, **add fallbacks** as written

3. Icons:

 - Logo - rotate it 180 deg and call it Clonify - add this text separately and **NOT** as a part of img
 - Different icons - cut and adjust [these](https://andrealimjoco.medium.com/redesigning-the-spotify-icon-suite-63f16853ba00) accordingly

4. [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to make everything **work** for real
   [Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/)
